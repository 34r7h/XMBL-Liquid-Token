# Test Coverage Summary

This document provides a summary of the test coverage for the XMBL Liquid Token project.

## Client (Vue.js)

The client-side tests are written using Vitest. The coverage seems to be focused on component rendering, basic user interactions, and store logic. However, there's a heavy reliance on mocking, which might hide potential integration issues.

- **Components**:
  - `DepositForm.vue`: Good coverage of UI rendering, validation, and user input. Mocks web3Service and stores.
  - `TransactionHistory.vue`: Good coverage of UI rendering, filtering, and sorting. Mocks transaction data.
  - `WalletConnect.vue`: Good coverage of wallet connection flow and UI states. Mocks wallet logic.
  - `XMBLPortfolio.vue`: Good coverage of portfolio display. Mocks portfolio data.
- **Services**:
  - `apiService.ts`: Well-tested with mocked fetch calls.
  - `web3Service.ts`: Tests are heavily mocked and don't interact with a real blockchain.
- **Stores**:
  - `portfolio.ts`, `protocol.ts`, `transactions.ts`, `wallet.ts`: All have good unit test coverage with mocked services.
- **Views**:
  - `Dashboard.vue`, `Home.vue`: Basic rendering tests, but lack interaction and integration tests.

**Overall Client Coverage**: Good unit test coverage, but lacks end-to-end and integration tests. The heavy use of mocking might not catch issues between components, stores, and services.

## Contracts (Solidity)

The smart contract tests are written using Hardhat and Chai. The tests cover the main functionalities of each contract.

- **`EthereumHTLC.sol`**: Good coverage of locking, claiming, and refunding funds.
- **`I1inchFusion.sol`**: Tests for the interface, but the actual implementation is mocked.
- **`ILimitOrderProtocol.sol`**: Similar to the Fusion interface, tests the mock implementation.
- **`IWormholeBridge.sol`**: Tests the mock implementation of the Wormhole bridge interface.
- **`Lock.sol`**: Basic lock contract with good test coverage, but it seems to be a sample contract and not directly related to the main protocol.
- **`OneInchHelper.sol`**: Good coverage of helper functions.
- **`XMBLToken.sol`**: Good coverage of NFT minting, TBA creation, and access control.
- **`XMBLVault.sol`**: Good coverage of deposit, withdrawal, and yield distribution logic.
- **`YieldManager.sol`**: Good coverage of fund deployment, harvesting, and rebalancing.

**Overall Contracts Coverage**: Good unit test coverage for individual contracts. However, there's a lack of integration tests between the contracts (e.g., `XMBLVault` interacting with `YieldManager` and `XMBLToken`).

## Server (Bun)

The server-side tests are written using Vitest. The coverage is focused on individual services and API controllers.

- **API**:
  - `controllers.test.ts`: Good coverage of API controllers with mocked services.
  - `routes.test.ts`: Good coverage of route registration and middleware.
- **App**:
  - `app.test.ts`: Good coverage of application initialization and shutdown.
- **Services**:
  - `bitcoinService.ts`: Tests are heavily mocked and don't interact with a real Bitcoin node.
  - `blockchainMonitor.ts`: Good coverage of event handling with mocked providers.
  - `oneInchService.ts`: Well-tested with mocked 1inch SDK and API calls.
  - `profitDistributionService.ts`: Good coverage of yield calculation and distribution logic.
  - `yieldManagementService.ts`: Good coverage of yield management strategies.
- **Utils**:
  - `secretGenerator.ts`: Good coverage of secret generation and hashing.

**Overall Server Coverage**: Good unit test coverage for individual services and controllers. Similar to the client, it lacks end-to-end and integration tests.

## Recommendations

1.  **End-to-End Testing**: Implement end-to-end tests for the entire system, from the client to the server and smart contracts. This will help identify integration issues that are currently missed by the unit tests.
2.  **Integration Testing**: Add integration tests for the smart contracts to ensure they work together as expected. For example, test the full flow of a user depositing funds into the `XMBLVault`, which then interacts with the `YieldManager` and `XMBLToken`.
3.  **Reduce Mocking**: While mocking is useful for unit tests, the project would benefit from tests that use real instances of services and contracts on a testnet. This will provide a more realistic testing environment.
4.  **Add Coverage for Skipped Tests**: Some tests are skipped (e.g., `Lock.test.js`). These should be reviewed and either completed or removed.
5.  **Test Real-World Scenarios**: The tests should cover more complex, real-world scenarios, such as handling network congestion, high gas fees, and failed transactions.
