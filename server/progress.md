# XMBL Server Development Progress

## Completed Steps

### Step 1: Core Application Structure ✅
**Completed**: Core app structure implemented and tested

**Implementation Details:**
- ✅ Replaced stub `src/app.ts` with full Bun server implementation
- ✅ Added service initialization order (database → services → monitoring)
- ✅ Setup error handling middleware and global handlers
- ✅ Configured API route mounting and WebSocket setup
- ✅ Added graceful shutdown mechanisms
- ✅ All tests passing in `src/__tests__/app.bun.test.ts`

**Features Implemented:**
- Service initialization with proper dependency order
- Environment variable validation
- Health check endpoint setup
- Background service management
- Graceful shutdown with cleanup
- Error handling for uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections
- Database connection management
- WebSocket configuration preparation
- Rate limiting and middleware configuration

**Test Results:** 9/9 tests passing
- Application initialization ✅
- Environment validation ✅
- Database connection setup ✅
- API route configuration ✅
- Background services startup ✅
- Health monitoring ✅
- Graceful shutdown ✅
