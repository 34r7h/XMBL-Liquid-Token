/**
 * yieldManagementService.ts
 * Purpose: Contains the logic for the "rental" aspect. This service would automate transferring BTC from your liquidity pool to yield-generating DeFi protocols (e.g., Compound, Aave) and harvesting the earned yield
 * 
 * Functions:
 * - deployToYieldProtocol(btcAmount: number, protocol: string): Promise<string>
 *   * Deploys BTC liquidity to yield-generating protocols
 *   * Arguments: amount of BTC, target protocol name
 *   * Returns: transaction hash of deployment
 * 
 * - harvestYield(): Promise<number>
 *   * Harvests accumulated yield from active positions
 *   * Returns: total yield amount harvested
 * 
 * - getActivePositions(): Promise<YieldPosition[]>
 *   * Retrieves all active yield positions
 *   * Returns: array of position objects with protocol, amount, APY
 * 
 * - calculateOptimalAllocation(availableBTC: number): Promise<AllocationStrategy>
 *   * Calculates optimal yield strategy allocation
 *   * Arguments: available BTC amount for deployment
 *   * Returns: allocation strategy across protocols
 * 
 * - rebalancePositions(): Promise<void>
 *   * Rebalances positions based on current yield rates
 *   * Automatically moves funds to higher-yielding opportunities
 * 
 * - withdrawFromProtocol(protocol: string, amount: number): Promise<string>
 *   * Withdraws specified amount from yield protocol
 *   * Arguments: protocol name, withdrawal amount
 *   * Returns: transaction hash
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * - Integration with Compound, Aave, other DeFi yield protocols
 * - Real-time yield rate monitoring and comparison
 * - Automated rebalancing based on profitability thresholds
 * - Risk management and position size limits
 * - Emergency withdrawal capabilities
 * - Yield tracking and reporting
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - ethers.js for blockchain interactions
 * - Protocol-specific SDKs (Compound, Aave)
 * - Price feeds for yield rate calculations
 * - Database for position tracking
 * - blockchainMonitor for event listening
