/**
 * blockchainMonitor.ts
 * Purpose: Uses ethers.js to listen for specific events emitted from your XMBLVault.sol contract on Ethereum (or L2s). This is vital for tracking deposits, swap completions, and triggering subsequent actions (like BTC bridging or yield deployment)
 * 
 * Functions:
 * - startEventListeners(): Promise<void>
 *   * Initializes and starts all contract event listeners
 *   * Sets up filters for XMBLVault events
 * 
 * - onDepositEvent(callback: (event: DepositEvent) => void): void
 *   * Registers callback for deposit events
 *   * Arguments: callback function to handle deposit events
 *   * Triggers: when users deposit ETH into vault
 * 
 * - onSwapCompleteEvent(callback: (event: SwapEvent) => void): void
 *   * Registers callback for swap completion events
 *   * Arguments: callback function to handle swap events
 *   * Triggers: when 1inch swap executes successfully
 * 
 * - onBridgeInitiatedEvent(callback: (event: BridgeEvent) => void): void
 *   * Registers callback for bridge initiation events
 *   * Arguments: callback function to handle bridge events
 *   * Triggers: when cross-chain bridge process begins
 * 
 * - onYieldDistributionEvent(callback: (event: YieldEvent) => void): void
 *   * Registers callback for yield distribution events
 *   * Arguments: callback function to handle yield events
 *   * Triggers: when yield is distributed to token holders
 * 
 * - getLatestBlockNumber(): Promise<number>
 *   * Gets current blockchain block number
 *   * Returns: latest block number
 * 
 * - resyncFromBlock(blockNumber: number): Promise<void>
 *   * Resyncs events from specified block
 *   * Arguments: starting block number for resync
 *   * Used for recovering missed events
 * 
 * - stopEventListeners(): void
 *   * Stops all active event listeners
 *   * Cleanup function for graceful shutdown
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * - Ethereum mainnet and L2 network support
 * - Event filtering and batching for efficiency
 * - Automatic reconnection on network issues
 * - Event persistence and replay capabilities
 * - Rate limiting to avoid RPC quota exhaustion
 * - Health monitoring and alerting
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - ethers.js for blockchain connectivity
 * - Contract ABIs for event parsing
 * - Database for event storage and tracking
 * - WebSocket connections for real-time updates
 * - Retry and exponential backoff utilities
