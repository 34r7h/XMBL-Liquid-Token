# XMBL-Liquid-Token

This is a defi protocol that ties in with the upcoming XMBL platform for rapid app generation, p2p web services, and yield generation from staking BTC.

Users deposit value into the system via BTC or any supported tokens. Supported tokens are converted to BTC and sent to the XMBL liquidity pool. When funds are sent to the pool, XMBL tokens are minted (priced according to an algorithmic bonding curve) and sent to the depositor. 

Funds from the liquidity pool are rented out to earn basis points which are distributed as dividend yields to XMBL token holders. 

We are utilizing One-Inch APIs, contracts, and workflows to enable swaps and provision liquidity for yield generation.
