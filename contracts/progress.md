# XMBL Smart Contracts Development Progress

## Step 1: Create Mock Contracts for Testing âœ… COMPLETED
**Objective**: Get test environment running with basic mock implementations

**Completed Tasks:**
- âœ… Verified Hardhat setup works: `npx hardhat compile`
- âœ… Created mock contracts needed by tests:
  - âœ… `contracts/mocks/MockERC20.sol` (used extensively in tests)
  - âœ… `contracts/mocks/MockOneInchRouter.sol` (for OneInchHelper tests)  
  - âœ… `contracts/mocks/MockDeFiProtocol.sol` (for integration tests)
  - âœ… `contracts/mocks/ERC6551Registry.sol` (ERC-6551 registry)
  - âœ… `contracts/mocks/TBAImplementation.sol` (Token Bound Account)
- âœ… All contracts compile successfully with Solidity 0.8.19
- âœ… Fixed Hardhat configuration and dependencies
- âœ… **Progress Update**: Mock contracts created and tests running

**Technical Notes:**
- Used OpenZeppelin Contracts v4.9.3 for compatibility with Solidity 0.8.19
- Mock contracts implement essential interfaces needed by the test suite
- All mock contracts include proper SPDX license identifiers and pragma versions
- MockERC20 provides full ERC-20 functionality with mint/burn capabilities
- MockOneInchRouter simulates 1inch DEX operations with configurable pricing
- MockDeFiProtocol simulates yield farming with configurable APY
- ERC6551Registry provides deterministic address generation for Token Bound Accounts
- TBAImplementation provides basic ERC-6551 Token Bound Account functionality

## Step 2: Implement XMBLToken.sol (ERC-721 + ERC-6551) âœ… COMPLETED
**Objective**: Make XMBLToken.test.js tests pass

**Completed Tasks:**
- âœ… Replaced stub file with full ERC-721 implementation (name, symbol, minting)
- âœ… Added ERC-6551 integration (TBA creation on mint with `mintWithTBA()`)
- âœ… Implemented access controls (MINTER_ROLE, admin functions)
- âœ… Added batch minting functionality (`batchMintWithTBA`)
- âœ… Added portfolio view functions (`getUserPortfolio`)
- âœ… Added NFT burning functionality (`burn()`)
- âœ… Implemented comprehensive metadata system with `tokenURI()`
- âœ… Added TBA execution functionality (`executeTBACall`)
- âœ… Fixed ethers v6 compatibility issues in tests
- âœ… All core contract functionality implemented and tested
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite covering all functionality (12 tests passing)
- âœ… Contract compiles successfully with no warnings
- âœ… **Progress Update**: XMBLToken implementation completed - Step 2 DONE! ðŸŽ‰

**Technical Notes:**
- Successfully implemented ERC-721 + ERC-6551 Token Bound Account integration
- Each NFT gets its own smart contract account (TBA) that can hold assets and execute transactions
- Fixed ethers v6 compatibility for deployment (await getAddress() instead of .address)
- Mock ERC6551Registry and TBAImplementation working correctly
- Comprehensive access control with MINTER_ROLE for secure operations
- Full metadata support with Base64-encoded JSON containing NFT attributes
- Portfolio management allows users to view all their NFTs and total deposit value
- Batch operations for efficient multiple NFT minting
- Clean burning functionality with proper data cleanup

**Test Coverage:**
- âœ… Basic NFT Operations (6 tests)
- âœ… Metadata & TokenURI (2 tests)  
- âœ… Burn Functionality (4 tests)
- âœ… All 12 tests passing with comprehensive coverage

**Gas Costs:**
- NFT Minting: ~299k gas
- Batch Minting: ~560k gas  
- Burning: ~74k gas
- Contract Deployment: ~3.2M gas

## Step 3: Implement YieldManager.sol ðŸ†• READY TO START
**Objective**: Create yield generation system for vault operations
- [ ] Replace stub file with yield management logic
- [ ] Implement Compound/Aave integration stubs (basic interface compliance)
- [ ] Add yield calculation and distribution logic
- [ ] Implement security controls and pause mechanisms
- [ ] Add vault permission system for yield operations
- [ ] Run `npx hardhat test test/unit/YieldManager.test.js`
- [ ] **Progress Update**: Mark "YieldManager implementation completed" in progress.md

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Step 3: Implementing YieldManager.sol for yield generation and distribution.
