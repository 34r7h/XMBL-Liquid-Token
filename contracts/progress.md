# XMBL Smart Contracts Development Progress

## Step 1: Create Mock Contracts for Testing ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Get test environment running with basic mock implementations

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Verified Hardhat setup works: `npx hardhat compile`
- ✅ Created mock contracts needed by tests:
  - ✅ `contracts/mocks/MockERC20.sol` (used extensively in tests)
  - ✅ `contracts/mocks/MockOneInchRouter.sol` (for OneInchHelper tests)  
  - ✅ `contracts/mocks/MockDeFiProtocol.sol` (for integration tests)
  - ✅ `contracts/mocks/ERC6551Registry.sol` (ERC-6551 registry)
  - ✅ `contracts/mocks/TBAImplementation.sol` (Token Bound Account)
- ✅ All contracts compile successfully with Solidity 0.8.19
- ✅ Fixed Hardhat configuration and dependencies
- ✅ **Progress Update**: Mock contracts created and tests running

**Technical Notes:**
- Used OpenZeppelin Contracts v4.9.3 for compatibility with Solidity 0.8.19
- Mock contracts implement essential interfaces needed by the test suite
- All mock contracts include proper SPDX license identifiers and pragma versions
- MockERC20 provides full ERC-20 functionality with mint/burn capabilities
- MockOneInchRouter simulates 1inch DEX operations with configurable pricing
- MockDeFiProtocol simulates yield farming with configurable APY
- ERC6551Registry provides deterministic address generation for Token Bound Accounts
- TBAImplementation provides basic ERC-6551 Token Bound Account functionality

## Step 2: Implement XMBLToken.sol (ERC-721 + ERC-6551)
**Objective**: Make XMBLToken.test.js tests pass
- [ ] Replace stub file with full ERC-721 implementation (name, symbol, minting)
- [ ] Add ERC-6551 integration (TBA creation on mint with `mintWithTBA()`)
- [ ] Implement access controls (MINTER_ROLE, admin functions)
- [ ] Add dividend distribution mechanisms from test requirements
- [ ] Add batch minting functionality (`batchMintWithTBA`)
- [ ] Add portfolio view functions (`getUserPortfolio`)
- [ ] Run `npx hardhat test test/unit/XMBLToken.test.js`
- [ ] **Progress Update**: Mark "XMBLToken implementation completed" in progress.md

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Step 2: Implementing XMBLToken.sol with ERC-721 and ERC-6551 functionality.
