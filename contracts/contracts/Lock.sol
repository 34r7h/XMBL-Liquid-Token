/**
 * @title Lock
 * @dev Hardhat-generated example contract for time-locked withdrawals
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * Default Hardhat template contract demonstrating basic Solidity patterns.
 * This contract can be used as reference or removed from production deployment.
 * Provides example of time-locked fund management and owner-based access control.
 * 
 * MAIN FUNCTIONS:
 * - constructor(uint _unlockTime) payable - Creates lock with specified unlock time
 * - withdraw() external - Withdraw funds after unlock time (owner only)
 * - getUnlockTime() external view returns (uint256) - Get unlock timestamp
 * - getBalance() external view returns (uint256) - Get contract balance
 * - getOwner() external view returns (address) - Get contract owner
 * - isUnlocked() external view returns (bool) - Check if unlock time has passed
 * 
 * STATE VARIABLES:
 * - uint256 public unlockTime - Timestamp when funds can be withdrawn
 * - address payable public owner - Owner who can withdraw funds
 * - bool public withdrawn - Flag to prevent multiple withdrawals
 * 
 * EVENTS:
 * - Withdrawal(uint amount, uint when) - Emitted when funds are withdrawn
 * - FundsLocked(uint amount, uint unlockTime, address owner) - Emitted on creation
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * - Must accept ETH deposits during construction
 * - Must enforce time-lock mechanism
 * - Must restrict withdrawals to owner only
 * - Must prevent re-entrancy attacks
 * - Must emit events for transparency
 * 
 * USAGE PATTERNS:
 * - Time-locked savings accounts
 * - Escrow services with time delays
 * - Vesting schedules for tokens
 * - Emergency fund mechanisms
 * 
 * SECURITY FEATURES:
 * - Time-lock enforcement
 * - Owner-only access control
 * - Single withdrawal protection
 * - Event logging for audit trail
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * This is a Hardhat template contract and may not be needed for the XMBL protocol.
 * Consider removing from production deployment unless time-locked functionality is required.
 * 
 * CONNECTED SYSTEM COMPONENTS:
 * - None (standalone template contract)
 * - Can be removed or repurposed for protocol-specific time-lock needs
