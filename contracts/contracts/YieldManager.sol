/**
 * @title YieldManager
 * @dev Contract responsible for deploying WBTC to yield protocols and harvesting yield for distribution
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * Manages the "rental" aspect of the protocol by automatically deploying WBTC liquidity
 * to yield-generating DeFi protocols (Compound, Aave, etc.) and harvesting accumulated yield
 * for distribution to XMBL token holders.
 * 
 * MAIN FUNCTIONS:
 * - deployFunds(address protocol, uint256 amount) external onlyVault - Deploy WBTC to yield protocol
 * - harvestYield() external returns (uint256) - Harvest accumulated yield from all positions
 * - withdrawFunds(address protocol, uint256 amount) external onlyVault - Withdraw from yield protocol
 * - rebalancePositions() external onlyOwner - Rebalance funds across protocols for optimal yield
 * - getActivePositions() external view returns (YieldPosition[] memory) - Get all active positions
 * - getTotalYield() external view returns (uint256) - Get total accumulated yield
 * - setYieldProtocol(address protocol, bool enabled) external onlyOwner - Enable/disable yield protocols
 * - emergencyWithdraw(address protocol) external onlyOwner - Emergency withdrawal from protocol
 * 
 * STATE VARIABLES:
 * - mapping(address => uint256) public protocolBalances - WBTC deployed to each protocol
 * - mapping(address => uint256) public accruedYield - Yield accumulated from each protocol
 * - mapping(address => bool) public enabledProtocols - Approved yield protocols
 * - address[] public activeProtocols - List of currently active protocols
 * - uint256 public totalDeployed - Total WBTC deployed across all protocols
 * - uint256 public totalYieldHarvested - Cumulative yield harvested
 * - uint256 public lastHarvestTime - Timestamp of last yield harvest
 * - address public vaultContract - Authorized vault contract
 * - uint256 public rebalanceThreshold - Threshold for triggering rebalancing
 * 
 * EVENTS:
 * - FundsDeployed(address indexed protocol, uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp)
 * - YieldHarvested(address indexed protocol, uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp)
 * - FundsWithdrawn(address indexed protocol, uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp)
 * - PositionsRebalanced(uint256 totalMoved, uint256 timestamp)
 * - ProtocolStatusChanged(address indexed protocol, bool enabled)
 * - EmergencyWithdrawal(address indexed protocol, uint256 amount)
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * - Must integrate with major DeFi yield protocols (Compound, Aave, etc.)
 * - Must optimize yield allocation across multiple protocols
 * - Must support automated rebalancing based on yield rates
 * - Must provide emergency withdrawal capabilities
 * - Must track all positions and yields accurately
 * - Must be gas-efficient for frequent harvesting
 * 
 * CONNECTED SYSTEM COMPONENTS:
 * - XMBLVault.sol - Calls deployFunds() when WBTC is available for yield
 * - XMBLToken.sol - Receives harvested yield for dividend distribution
 * - server/yieldManagementService.ts - Monitors and triggers yield operations
 * - server/profitDistributionService.ts - Distributes harvested yields
 * - client/XMBLPortfolio.vue - Displays yield positions and APY
 * 
 * YIELD STRATEGY:
 * - Multi-protocol diversification for risk management
 * - Automated yield rate monitoring and optimization
 * - Dynamic rebalancing based on protocol performance
 * - Emergency exit mechanisms for protocol risks
 * 
 * SECURITY FEATURES:
 * - Access control for fund deployment and withdrawal
 * - Emergency pause and withdrawal mechanisms
 * - Position limits to prevent over-concentration
 * - Slippage protection for large movements
 * 
 * GAS OPTIMIZATION:
 * - Batch operations for multiple protocol interactions
 * - Selective harvesting based on profitability thresholds
 * - Efficient storage patterns for position tracking
