 * - Initiating 1inch swaps to convert deposited tokens to WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) using the 1inch Fusion+ protocol or Limit Order Protocol interfaces
 * - Interacting with a bridge (like Wormhole) to send WBTC to native BTC on the Bitcoin network for the liquidity pool
 * - Minting XMBLToken.sol to depositors based on your algorithmic bonding curve logic
 * - Managing the "liquidity pool" and interacting with your YieldManager.sol or similar for yield generation
 * - Functions for profit distribution or enabling the server to trigger it
