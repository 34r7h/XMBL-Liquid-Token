/**
 * XMBLToken.test.js
 * PURPOSE: Comprehensive test suite for XMBLToken ERC-6551 NFT contract functionality
 * 
 * TEST CATEGORIES:
 * 
 * 1. BASIC ERC-721 (NFT) FUNCTIONALITY:
 * - NFT deployment with correct name, symbol
 * - NFT minting with unique token IDs
 * - Transfer functionality between accounts
 * - Approval and operator mechanisms
 * - TransferFrom functionality for NFTs
 * - Token URI and metadata handling
 * - Owner enumeration and balance tracking
 * 
 * 2. ERC-6551 TOKEN BOUND ACCOUNT FUNCTIONALITY:
 * - TBA creation for each minted NFT
 * - TBA address calculation and verification
 * - TBA ownership inheritance from NFT
 * - TBA transaction execution capabilities
 * - TBA balance tracking and management
 * - Cross-TBA interactions and composability
 * 
 * 3. MINTING FUNCTIONALITY:
 * - Only authorized minter can mint NFTs
 * - Mint function creates NFT with TBA correctly
 * - Mint function assigns unique token IDs
 * - Unauthorized minting attempts fail
 * - Minting to zero address fails
 * - TBA creation during minting process
 * 
 * 4. BURNING FUNCTIONALITY:
 * - Users can burn their own NFTs
 * - Burning destroys NFT and associated TBA
 * - Cannot burn NFTs not owned by sender
 * - TBA cleanup on NFT burn
 * 
 * 5. DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION (PER NFT):
 * - Only dividend distributor can distribute to TBAs
 * - Dividends distributed proportionally to NFT deposit values
 * - Individual TBA dividend balance tracking
 * - Multiple distributions accumulate correctly per NFT
 * - Batch distribution to multiple TBAs
 * 
 * 6. DIVIDEND CLAIMING (PER NFT):
 * - NFT owners can claim dividends for their specific NFTs
 * - Claiming sends yields to NFT's Token Bound Account
 * - Cannot claim more than entitled per NFT
 * - Multiple claims handled correctly per NFT
 * - Gas efficiency of individual vs batch claiming
 * - TBA receives dividends automatically
 * 
 * 7. TOKEN BOUND ACCOUNT OPERATIONS:
 * - TBA can execute transactions on behalf of NFT
 * - TBA can hold and manage ETH and tokens
 * - TBA can interact with other DeFi protocols
 * - TBA ownership verification matches NFT owner
 * - TBA transaction authorization and limits
 * 
 * 8. ACCESS CONTROL:
 * - Owner can set minter address
 * - Owner can set dividend distributor
 * - Owner can set TBA implementation contract
 * - Non-owners cannot change permissions
 * - Ownership transfer functionality
 * - Role revocation functionality
 * 
 * 9. PAUSABLE FUNCTIONALITY:
 * - Owner can pause NFT transfers
 * - Paused state blocks transfers
 * - Owner can unpause token transfers
 * - Pause doesn't affect other functions
 * - Emergency pause scenarios
 * 
 * 8. EDGE CASES AND SECURITY:
 * - Reentrancy protection in dividend claims
 * - Overflow/underflow protection
 * - Zero address validations
 * - Large number handling
 * - Gas limit considerations
 * 
 * EXPECTED TEST STRUCTURE:
 * 
 * describe("XMBLToken", function() {
 *   describe("Deployment", function() {
 *     it("Should set the right name and symbol")
 *     it("Should assign total supply to owner")
 *   })
 * 
 *   describe("Minting", function() {
 *     it("Should allow authorized minter to mint")
 *     it("Should reject unauthorized minting")
 *   })
 * 
 *   describe("Burning", function() {
 *     it("Should allow users to burn tokens")
 *     it("Should decrease total supply on burn")
 *   })
 * 
 *   describe("Dividends", function() {
 *     it("Should distribute dividends proportionally")
 *     it("Should allow claiming of dividends")
 *   })
 * 
 *   describe("Access Control", function() {
 *     it("Should allow owner to set minter")
 *     it("Should reject non-owner permission changes")
 *   })
 * 
 *   describe("Pausable", function() {
 *     it("Should pause and unpause transfers")
 *   })
 * })
 * 
 * TEST FIXTURES AND HELPERS:
 * - Deploy contract with initial parameters
 * - Create test accounts with different roles
 * - Helper functions for token operations
 * - Utility functions for dividend calculations
 * - Mock contracts for integration testing
 * 
 * INTEGRATION SCENARIOS:
 * - Test with XMBLVault as minter
 * - Test with YieldManager as dividend distributor
 * - Test realistic user interaction flows
 * - Test emergency scenarios and recovery
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE TESTS:
 * - Gas usage optimization verification
 * - Large-scale dividend distribution tests
 * - Batch operation efficiency tests
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * - Use Hardhat testing framework
 * - Include proper assertion libraries (chai)
 * - Mock external dependencies
 * - Test both happy path and error cases
 * - Verify event emissions
 * - Check state changes thoroughly
